# ParallelPrograming
University Course: Parallel Programing
Given by prof. Zbigniew Koza and dr Maciej Matyka

This course touched briefly some methods of parallel computing in the following technologies
* Modern C++
* OpenMP
* MPI
* CUDA
Beside that, some basic ideas as reductors and synchronization problems were considered.

There were some minor exercises from all of these technologies and two major projects from MPI and CUDA. The project reports and some code which survived are fiven in this repo.
